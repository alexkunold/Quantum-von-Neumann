# Quantum von Neumann 
## Quantum simulation for the von Neumann equation in Qiskit
### vonNeumannQuantum.ipynb

This is a Python 3 jupyter notebook containing a quantum algorithm
in Qiskit
that calculates the time evolution of de density matrix governed
to von Neumann equation.

To run the notebook just place it in any directory on your file
system and run all the cells sequentially.
The file contains two examples. The first runs very fast even in a laptop.
The second can take about an hour of run time depending on the characteristics
of your computer.

In the code you will find references to the paper arXiv http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08775 .
