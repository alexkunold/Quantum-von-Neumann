Hi, I’m @alexkunold
I’m interested in quantum algorithms
I’m currently learning how to write quantum algorithms in Qiskit
This is a Python 3 jupyter notebook containing a quantum algorithm
that calculated the time evolution of de density matrix according
to von Neumann equation.

To run the notebook just place it in any directory on your file
system and run all the cells sequentially.
